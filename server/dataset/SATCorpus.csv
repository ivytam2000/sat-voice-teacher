What is attachment theory?,Attachment theory is a psychological theory concerning relationships between humans. \n The most important tenet is that young children need to develop a relationship with one or more primary caregivers for healthy social and emotional development. \n The theory was formulated by psychoanalyst John Bowlby.,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory,"[{""DisplayOrder"":1,""QnaId"":303,""DisplayText"":""Role-play in SAT""}]",1,FALSE,TRUE
What is attachment?,"In attachment theory, ""attachment"" refers to the emotional bond between 2 individuals, typically a caregiver and a child. This can be a reciprocal bond between 2 adults. But between a child and caregiver, the bond centers around the child's need for safety, security, and protection. In child-to-adult relationships, the child's connection is referred to as ""attachment,"" and the reciprocal bond from the caregiver's side is known as the ""care-giving bond"".",,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory,"[{""DisplayOrder"":1,""QnaId"":400,""DisplayText"":""Attachment Styles""},{""DisplayOrder"":2,""QnaId"":401,""DisplayText"":""Attachment Behaviour""}, {""DisplayOrder"":3,""QnaId"":7,""DisplayText"":""Biological Explanations of Attachment""}]",2,FALSE,FALSE
Does attachment behaviour indicate security?,"The strength of a child's attachment behaviour in a given circumstance does not indicate the 'strength' of the attachment bond.

How does attachment change from childhood to adolescence?,"As children grow, attachment behaviours evolve, with negotiation and bargaining becoming common during the preschool period. \n In middle childhood (ages 7 to 11), children form goal-corrected partnerships with parents, prioritize availability over proximity, and become more self-reliant. \n By adolescence, the attachment system acts as a safety regulator, responding to potential danger or stress. \n Their maturity influences the activation of the attachment system, although they still value their attachment figures, they can navigate certain situations without significant distress.",,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory,"[{""DisplayOrder"":1,""QnaId"":180,""DisplayText"":""self-attachment""},{""DisplayOrder"":2,""QnaId"":401,""DisplayText"":""Attachment Behaviour""}]",4,FALSE,FALSE
What attachment styles are there in adults?,"Attachment theory was extended to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. \n Four styles of attachment have been identified in adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. \n These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, anxious or ambivalent, avoidant and disorganized attachment.

What are the biological explanations of attachment?,"The quality of caregiving received during childhood have been found to directly affect an individual's stress regulation and immune system functioning. \n Research has found that negative experiences during early childhood produce  pro-inflammatory phenotype cells in the immune system, which is directly related to cardiovascular, autoimmune disease and certain types of cancer. \n Inherited genetic factors have also been found to play a role in shaping attachments, such as specific gene polymorphisms linked to anxious or avoidant attachment. In adulthood, attachment styles are related to immune biomarkers.\n  Avoidant attachment is associated with higher levels of interleukin-6 during stress, while anxious attachment is linked to elevated cortisol production and reduced T cell counts.

What are the attachment behaviours in infants?,"Pre-attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life. \n In the first eight weeks of being born, infants use smiles, babbling, and crying to seek attention from anyone nearby. \n In the second phase (two to six months), they start to differentiate between familiar and unfamiliar adults, showing more responsiveness towards the caregiver. They also exhibit behaviours like following and clinging. \n By the end of the first year, infants display attachment behaviors to maintain proximity, such as protesting separation, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when scared, and following when possible. As infants develop mobility, they use the caregiver as a ""safe base"" for exploration. When the caregiver is present, exploration increases, but if the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive, attachment behaviors intensify. \n After the second year, children form a more complex partnership with the caregiver, recognizing others' feelings and adjusting their actions accordingly.",,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory,[],14,FALSE,FALSE
What are the principles of attachment theory?,Modern attachment theory is based on three principles:\n\n 1.  Bonding is an intrinsic human need.\n 2.

How is attachment related to different cultures?,"In Western cultures, we often emphasize a single attachment to the mother as the primary caregiver. However, research shows that having multiple caregivers can also lead to secure and emotionally well-adjusted children. Studies in Israel, the Netherlands, and East Africa have found that children with multiple caregivers not only feel secure but also develop a broader perspective of the world. This is evident in hunter-gatherer communities, like those in rural Tanzania, where various individuals help care for children. In places like non-metropolitan India, where extended families are common, children have several caregivers, including grandparents and other relatives, who enrich their social and emotional development. While there are cultural differences, research supports the universal aspects of attachment theory. It shows that secure attachment is desirable and prevalent, maternal sensitivity influences attachment patterns, and specific attachments in infancy can predict later social and cognitive skills.","Research has shown that children can form secure attachment with multiple caregivers, extending beyond just the mother.\n This is observed in different cultures such as many asian cultures like India where extended families are common and children have several caregivers including grandparents and relatives. \n While there are cultural differences, research supports the universal aspects of attachment theory: secure attachment is desirable and prevalent, maternal sensitivity influences attachment patterns, and specific attachments in infancy can predict later social and cognitive skills.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory,[],16,FALSE,FALSE

What is secure attachment in infants?,"Secure attachment in toddlers is characterized by freely exploring their environment in the presence of a familiar caregiver. They engage with strangers, become visibly upset when the caregiver leaves, and show happiness upon their return. The child's temperamental makeup and situational factors can influence the extent of exploration and distress alongside attachment status. A secure attachment is formed when the primary caregiver consistently responds to the child's needs. This creates a sense of security and trust in the child, knowing that their needs will be met. Securely attached children have a secure base with their caregiver, allowing them to explore confidently and receive assistance when needed. This attachment style is considered the most adaptive, as it fosters resilience and effective coping skills. Caring and attentive parents in infancy and early childhood contribute to the development of secure attachment in children.","Secure attachment in infants is characterized by freely exploring their surroundings while their caregiver is present, showing distress when the caregiver leaves, and finding comfort and happiness upon the caregiver's return.

What is anxious or ambivalent attachment?,"Anxious or ambivalent attachment,is characterized by limited exploration and wariness of strangers even in the presence of the caregiver. When the caregiver leaves, the child becomes highly distressed, often crying or screaming. Upon the caregiver's return, the child displays ambivalent behavior. This attachment style develops in response to unpredictably responsive caregiving and can be seen as a conditional strategy to maintain the caregiver's availability. Research suggests that children with abusive childhood experiences are more likely to develop ambivalent attachments. These children may face challenges in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.",,Editorial,"[{""DisplayOrder"":1,""QnaId"":175,""DisplayText"":""secure attachment in infants""}, {""DisplayOrder"":2,""QnaId"":177,""DisplayText"":""avoidant attachment""},{""DisplayOrder"":2,""QnaId"":178,""DisplayText"":""disorganized attachment""}]",176,FALSE,FALSE
What is avoidant attachment?,"
Infants with an avoidant attachment pattern tend to avoid or ignore their caregiver, showing little emotion upon separation or reunion. They exhibit limited exploration regardless of who is present. This behavior can be seen as a mask for underlying distress, as studies have shown increased heart rate in avoidant infants. Avoidant infants have a history of experiencing unresponsive caregiving, leading them to believe that expressing their emotional needs has no impact on the caregiver. Avoidance serves two functions for these infants: maintaining conditional proximity to the caregiver for protection while avoiding potential rejection, and directing attention away from unfulfilled desires for closeness to prevent overwhelming emotions.","Avoidant attachment in infants is characterized by avoiding or ignoring the caregiver, showing little emotional response during separation and reunion.
